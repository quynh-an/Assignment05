\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec3 This assignment is to practice my understanding of OOP, or object oriented programming in Python. I made ten functions within a class and used methods to perform basic computations and tasks to practice class creation, method definition, and invoking methods with user input. \
\
The program runs as so: Select a number 1-10 to perform a task. Once a task is selected, you will then be asked for some sort of user input and a task will be completed. Then, the program will end.}
